# Annotations from comments

JSON schema is partially implemented in this tool. It uses line comments to add annotations for the schema because head comments are frequently used by humans and tools like helm-docs. The following annotations are supported:
* [Validation Keywords for Any Instance Type](#strings)
* [Numbers](#numbers)
* [Booleans](#booleans)
* [Arrays](#arrays)
* [Objects](#objects)
* [Nulls](#nulls)
* [Required](#required)
* [Enum](#enum)
